# Translate UI
</center>

## Problem Statement

- Some customers want to take advantage of AWS services without or donâ€™t have access to AWS console or using the SDKs.
- Customers want to leverage AWS services in a low frictionless manner (browsing a websites or integrated into existing applications), rather than having to build and integrate their own custom code for each service.
- Customers have limited access to certain services due to Security & Compliance and therefore require a solution to help meet their mission

## Architecture <br><br>

Infrastructure has been hosted on AWS Cloud by using various AWS services(as seen in the architecture below) and other IaC services like AWS CDK. We've implemented AWS Well-Architected Framework in designing this serverless-architecture to help meet scale, cost and less-operational overhead.React Framework has been used to develop the front-end of this application.<br><i><center>Please view specific READ.ME for further information</center></i><br><br>

## FAQs
<i>What is an estimated cost of this architecture?</i><br>
- Cost will vary by region and availability of services. Please view attached video to understand the costs

<i>What were some of the biggest challenges in completing this project?</i><br>
- Solving this using services that are available at hand in a way that can be provisioned using IaC services

<i>How are we handling document translation?</i><br>
- We're using same API for text translation but we're chunking the file as best as possible and appending the translation while ensuring meaning of the sentence isn't lost

<i>Why take the server-less approach?</i><br>
- It's easy to scale, less over-head management and cost-effective

<i>How long does it take to translate a single-document?</i><br>
- There are variety of factors that could affect the performence(time). However, it takes at-most 1 minute to translate a single, text document (5-10kb)
